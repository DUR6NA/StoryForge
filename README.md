**StoryForge** is a powerful, open-source game engine and launcher designed to empower creators to build complex RPGs, Visual Novels, and Text Adventures without writing a single line of code. 

Whether you are crafting a sprawling fantasy epic, a cozy dating sim, or a gritty noir detective mystery, StoryForge provides the tools to bring your narrative to life.

## 🚀 Key Features

StoryForge combines the ease of a visual editor with the depth of a full RPG engine.

*   **Visual Node-Based Editor**: detailed graph editor for managing complex branching narratives, dialogue trees, and location connections.
*   **Deep RPG Systems**: Built-in support for:
    *   **Inventory & Item Effects**: Create items that boost stats, unlock paths, or trigger events.
    *   **Multi-Currency Economy**: Design complex markets with gold, credits, gems, or faction reputation.
    *   **Quests & Journal**: Track player progress with multi-stage quests.
    *   **Variables & Logic**: Global switches and variables to remember player choices forever.
*   **Character Customization**: A robust **Paperdoll System** allows players to customize their avatar (Hair, Clothes, Body) with layered images and colorways.
*   **Interactive World**:
    *   **Dynamic Time**: Day/Night cycles that automatically change location backgrounds (Dawn, Day, Dusk, Night).
    *   **Living Locations**: Assign specific interactions, NPCs, and secrets to every scene.
*   **Ren'Py-Style Dialogue**: Full visual novel mode with character sprites, text boxes, and cinematic storytelling.
*   **Integrated Launcher**: Manage multiple projects, playtest instantly, and customize your engine theme (Cyberpunk, Nature, Fantasy, and more).

## 🌌 Possibilities

The engine is agnostic to genre, allowing for a wide range of game types:

*   **Visual Novels**: Focus on character relationships, branching dialogue, and beautiful character art. Use the dedicated Dialogue Tree editor to script emotional scenes.
*   **Role-Playing Games (RPGs)**: Lean into the stats system. Create combat encounters (via skill checks), intricate crafting loops, and merchant economies.
*   **Simulation Games**: Build a life sim where players manage energy, work jobs, simulate days, and decorate their home.
*   **Text Adventures**: Create classic parser-like experiences with modern UI conveniences.
