# User Themes Directory

This folder contains user-uploaded custom themes.

Each theme is stored in its own subdirectory with a `theme.json` file and optional assets.

## To add a theme manually:

1. Create a folder with your theme's ID as the name
2. Add a `theme.json` file following the theme structure
3. Add any optional assets (images, sounds, videos)
4. Restart the launcher to see your theme

## Example:

```
user/
├── my-cool-theme/
│   ├── theme.json
│   ├── preview.png
│   ├── background.jpg
│   └── click.mp3
```
